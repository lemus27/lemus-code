 * This sample program is a minimal Java application showing JDBC access to a
 * Derby database.</p>
 * <p>
 * Instructions for how to run this program are
 * given in <A HREF=example.html>example.html</A>, by default located in the
 * same directory as this source file ($DERBY_HOME/demo/programs/simple/).</p>
 * <p>
 * Derby applications can run against Derby running in an embedded
 * or a client/server framework.</p>
 * <p>
 * When Derby runs in an embedded framework, the JDBC application and Derby
 * run in the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The application
 * starts up the Derby engine.</p>
 * <p>
 * When Derby runs in a client/server framework, the application runs in a
 * different JVM from Derby. The application only needs to load the client
 * driver, and the connectivity framework (in this case the Derby Network
 * Server) provides network connections.</p>

     * <p>
     * When you run this application, you may give one of the following
     * arguments:
     *  <ul>
          <li><code>embedded</code> - default, if none specified. Will use
     *        Derby's embedded driver. This driver is included in the derby.jar
     *        file.</li>
     *    <li><code>derbyclient</code> - will use the Derby client driver to
     *        access the Derby Network Server. This driver is included in the
     *        derbyclient.jar file.</li>
     *  </ul>
     * <p>
     * When you are using a client/server framework, the network server must
     * already be running when trying to obtain client connections to Derby.
     * This demo program will will try to connect to a network server on this
     * host (the localhost), see the <code>protocol</code> instance variable.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When running this demo, you must include the correct driver in the
     * classpath of the JVM. See <a href="example.html">example.html</a> for
     * details.
     * </p>
     * @param args This program accepts one optional argument specifying which
     *        connection framework (JDBC driver) to use (see above). The default
     *        is to use the embedded JDBC driver.
